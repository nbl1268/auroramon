Aurora Monitor is a graphical application which continuously monitors the power output and other information from either one or two Power-One Aurora inverters.   ( http://www.power-one.it/ ). It runs under Linux and Windows.

It is intended for use with Aurora power inverters in domestic solar-voltaic power generation installations.

Aurora Monitor displays continuously updated graphs, numerical values, and alarm status.

It can send data to www.pvoutput.org every 5 minutes.

Aurora Monitor stores the data so that graphs from previous days can be displayed or analysed.

Aurora Monitor on Linux needs the wxWidgets libraries (libwxgtk2.8) to be installed. The Windows version is compiled to include the wxWidgets libraries which it needs.
